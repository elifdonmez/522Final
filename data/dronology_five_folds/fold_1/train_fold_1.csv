ST-180,An N vector is a normal Vector that points out from the surface of the WGS reference ellipsoid The normal vector is combined with an altitude which represents the distance above or below the reference ellipsoid note this is the distance above sea level as sea level is defined as the surface of the ellipsoid in WGS The n vector and altitude together precisely define a position on Earth The n vector should be a unit vector i e a vector with a magnitude The altitude should be in meters Why we need this In dead reckoning calculations we need to take a position and add a velocity vector to it Drones often stay at constant elevations as they travel around the Earth This is a problem when using p vectors and velocity vectors The instantaneous velocity is tangent to the reference ellipsoid and thus follows the curvature of the Earth In aviation it is common to use n vectors because there is a nice formula that addresses this exact problem This also makes programming easier when considering edge cases like a drone flying east near the meridian where longitude degrees Using latitude and longitude for this calculation requires special logic to handle the transition to longitude degrees but no special logic is required when using n vectors N vectors also handle gracefully the poles where longitude is undefined For more information about n vectors see this article The following instance fields are needed in the nvector class x the x component of the n vector y the y component of the n vector z the z component of the n vector altitude the distance above sea level in meters The following methods are needed in the n vector class toLla takes no arguments and maps the n vector and altitude to a latitude longitude and altitude toPvec takes no arguments and maps the n vector and altitude to an X Y and Z coordinate in the WGS reference frame,0
ST-178,We need an immutable class holding three doubles for latitude longitude and altitude LLA This class should have the following data members latitude the angle north of the equator in degrees negative angles define latitudes in the southern hemisphere longitude the angle east of the prime meridian in degrees negative angles define longitudes in the western hemisphere altitude the distance above sea level or more precisely the distance above the surface of the WGS reference ellipsoid For this project we need this distance in meters though traditionally in aviation this distance is measured in feet so be careful when using this class This class should have the following methods toPvec takes no arguments and maps LLA to an X Y and Z coordinate in the WGS reference frame toNvec takes no arguments and maps LLA to a coordinate defined by an N vector plus altitude An N vector is a normal vector on the surface of the WGS reference ellipsoid This ellipsoid defines the position of sea level everywhere on Earth By pairing this with an altitude we can precisely define a position N vectors have nice properties that make dead reckoning easier and more accurate Dead reckoning is the process of calculating a drones current position by using a previously determined position and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course See for more info To learn more about the nice properties that n vectors have see this article from The Journal of Navigation Perhaps Coordinate java may be modified into the LlaCoordinate class we need,0
