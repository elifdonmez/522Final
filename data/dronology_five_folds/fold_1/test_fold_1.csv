ST-260,To see if the haversine distance is an acceptable method for computing distance it should be compared to travel distance and laser distance travel distance is the distance a drone would actually have to travel to get there accounting for the shape of the Earth and assuming that changes in altitude would be gradual laser distance is the distance a laser beam would travel assuming line of sight So it would compute this distance even when a laser would need to travel through the Earth For example if point A was at the North Pole and point B was at the South Pole the laser distance would tell you the distance straight through the Earth,0
