ST-260,To see if the haversine distance is an acceptable method for computing distance it should be compared to travel distance and laser distance travel distance is the distance a drone would actually have to travel to get there accounting for the shape of the Earth and assuming that changes in altitude would be gradual laser distance is the distance a laser beam would travel assuming line of sight So it would compute this distance even when a laser would need to travel through the Earth For example if point A was at the North Pole and point B was at the South Pole the laser distance would tell you the distance straight through the Earth,0
ST-261,This function should take two wgs position one for the current position and another for the target position and the number of meters to travel it should return a new wgs position that is the specified distance away,0
ST-286,Everyone should get to work with the position class that they are most comfortable with And to enable everyone to get the most out of the position classes distance functions should be provided to all classes That is what motivates this abstract base class The class should have these methods laser Distance that takes another WGS position returns a double travel distance that takes another WGS position returns a double toNvector returns an NVector toPVector returns a PVector toLlaCoordinate returns an LlaCoordinate toRotMatrix returns a matrix that can take displacement vectors from ECEF and rotate them into NED vectors,0

ST-180,An N vector is a normal Vector that points out from the surface of the WGS reference ellipsoid The normal vector is combined with an altitude which represents the distance above or below the reference ellipsoid note this is the distance above sea level as sea level is defined as the surface of the ellipsoid in WGS The n vector and altitude together precisely define a position on Earth The n vector should be a unit vector i e a vector with a magnitude The altitude should be in meters Why we need this In dead reckoning calculations we need to take a position and add a velocity vector to it Drones often stay at constant elevations as they travel around the Earth This is a problem when using p vectors and velocity vectors The instantaneous velocity is tangent to the reference ellipsoid and thus follows the curvature of the Earth In aviation it is common to use n vectors because there is a nice formula that addresses this exact problem This also makes programming easier when considering edge cases like a drone flying east near the meridian where longitude degrees Using latitude and longitude for this calculation requires special logic to handle the transition to longitude degrees but no special logic is required when using n vectors N vectors also handle gracefully the poles where longitude is undefined For more information about n vectors see this article The following instance fields are needed in the nvector class x the x component of the n vector y the y component of the n vector z the z component of the n vector altitude the distance above sea level in meters The following methods are needed in the n vector class toLla takes no arguments and maps the n vector and altitude to a latitude longitude and altitude toPvec takes no arguments and maps the n vector and altitude to an X Y and Z coordinate in the WGS reference frame,0
ST-179,We need an immutable class holding three doubles for X Y and Z in the WGS reference frame Here is some background information about the WGS reference frame The origin of this frame is at the center of mass of the Earth The X axis points towards where the equator meets the prime meridean latitude longitude The Z axis points towards the geographic north pole latitude longitude undefined The Y axis can be derived using right hand rule and points towards latitude longitude This class should have the following instance fields x the position along the X axis in meters y the position along the Y axis in meters z the position along the Z axis in meters This class should have the following methods toLla takes no arguments and returns the latitude longitude and altitude for this position toNvec takes no arguments and returns the n vector plus altitude for this position,0
